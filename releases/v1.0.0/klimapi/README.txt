Calculate and compensate the unavoidable CO2 emissions of your products and services together with your customers.

== Description ==

It has never been more important to consider climate protection in all aspects of life. The first priority should always be to reduce CO2 emissions, but unfortunately it is not always possible to avoid them completely. In this case it is a good option to compensate the unavoidable CO2 emissions through climate protection projects. For this purpose KlimAPI offers an extensive API, but not everyone can or wants to program. This plugin offers an extensive integration of our system in WooCommerce without having to write a line of code.

**We are constantly developing our system. So if you have a suggestion for a feature don\'t hesitate to contact us.**

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
